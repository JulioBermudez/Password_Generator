## Description
A random password generator is a tool or program that generates a unique, strong, and random password composed of a combination of letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters. These passwords are designed to be highly secure and difficult to guess or crack by potential attackers.

Using a random password generator is highly recommended for creating secure passwords, as manually creating passwords may often result in predictable or easily guessable combinations. In addition, it is advisable to use a different password for each online account or service to minimize the risk of compromising multiple accounts if a password is compromised.
